# Bank-Application
It's a simple bank application using core java 

This project focuses on implementing the fundamentals of Java programming, including:
âœ” Control flow (if-else, switch, loops)
âœ” User input/output handling
âœ” Basic transaction logic (deposit, withdraw, check balance)

It was a great exercise to strengthen my problem-solving skills and understand how core Java can be used to build functional applications. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and transition into more advanced topics like OOP and data structures in my upcoming projects.ðŸš€
